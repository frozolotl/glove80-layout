# Glove80 Layout
This is [frozolotl](https://github.com/frozolotl)'s layout for the [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/) keyboard.

## Goals
- Good for German and especially English.
- Easily accessible symbols optimized for programming.
- Games should be playable without much configuration.
- Home-row mods without much finagling.
- Long-term efficiency is prioritized over being easy to learn.

## Requirements
Use the following keyboard configuration:
- Layout: `us`
- Variant: `de_se_fi`
- Options: `eurosign:e,compose:rctrl`
